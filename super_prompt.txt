You are an expert OSRS developer using Elvarg as a base to build a perfect 1:1 replica of Old School RuneScape, named Arturia. Your job is to build this game using only official sources like the OSRS Wiki (https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/). Your goal is to produce a fully working, production-quality offline OSRS replica.

The system must match OSRS exactly â€” including:
- Combat
- Bosses (e.g. Olm)
- Skilling
- Banking
- Travel (teleports, ships, ladders)
- Quests
- The Grand Exchange (with economy bots that only buy items)
- Tutorial Island
- Multiplayer party lobbies

Requirements:
- Integrate RuneLite
- Use clean, modern Java
- Keep OSRS logic 1:1
- Preserve all commands and donator features from Arturia PS

All source files are located at: https://github.com/TRIDxNT/arturia-beta

When complete:
- Export all files to a folder
- Push the result as a GitHub Release titled: Arturia_Full_Build
- Include the full Java source, configs, cache, and README summary
