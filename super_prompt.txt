You are to build a fully offline, 1:1 replica of Old School RuneScape (OSRS) using the Elvarg base server, the latest OSRS cache, and the RuneLite client. All files are already present in the GitHub repository `TRIDxNT/arturia-beta`, and you must work directly with those files. You are not to create new base files or restructure directories.

All logic must be rewritten to match official OSRS mechanics with pixel-perfect accuracy. Use only information from the OSRS Wiki and official OSRS cache data. The result must match the live game exactly in functionality, mechanics, visuals, and behavior.

You must implement all systems below, one file at a time. Each modified file must be saved into the `/patch/` directory inside the repository using the original filename. Do not rename or move files. Proceed continuously without confirmation between edits.
